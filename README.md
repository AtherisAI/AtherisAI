# Atheris

Atheris is a full-stack intelligence layer built on **Solana**. Designed for real-time decision-making, coordination, and insight, Atheris connects decentralized systems with AI agents that adapt, learn, and act.

## Overview

Atheris isn’t just another dashboard or AI wrapper. It’s:
- A real-time, intelligent infrastructure for Web3.
- Focused exclusively on the Solana blockchain.
- Committed to composable, scalable coordination.

## Architecture

- **Master Agent**: Coordinates and delegates to specialized agents.
- **Embedded AI Agents**:
  - Learning agents
  - Analytical agents
  - Output agents
- **Interactive AI Agents**:
  - Responder agents
  - ChatBot agents

## What Makes Atheris Different?

We’re not:
- Another dashboard
- Another AI wrapper

We are:
- A full-stack intelligence layer for Web3, one that understands your environment and acts on it.

From DAOs to L1s:
- Atheris adapts to the complexity of your ecosystem and delivers clarity, strategy, and scale.

## Built on Solana

Atheris is 100% built on the Solana blockchain for speed, efficiency, and scalability. Our infrastructure focuses entirely on intelligent coordination and real-time data for protocols, DAOs, and decentralized organizations.

## Status
Atheris is under active development.
Modules are being tested internally and will be open-sourced soon.

## Vision

Atheris aims to become the core coordination and intelligence layer for the decentralized web, starting with Solana. We believe AI agents can enable a new level of clarity, efficiency, and scale across Web3 systems.
